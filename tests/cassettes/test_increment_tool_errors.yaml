      following criteria:\\n\\n1. **Relevance:** How closely does the title relate
      to the core topic? For scoring higher points, the title should explicitly mention
      the key elements of the subject matter.\\n\\n2. **Insightfulness:** Does the
      title imply that the content will provide deep, meaningful insights? A higher
      score is given if the title suggests a comprehensive, thoughtful analysis.\\n\\n3.
      **Engagement Potential:** How likely is the title to attract and engage the
      intended audience? Titles that are clear, thought-provoking, and promise valuable
      information tend to score higher.\\n\\n**Examples based on the above criteria:**\\n\\n1.
      **Relevance**\\n   - High Score: \\\"The impact of AI on the future of work\\\"
